![My first window](/rubygtkfun/images/posts/warming-up.png){:class="aside-image"}

Before we sturt just make sure you installed gtk3 gem on your system and type the command:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install gtk3
{% endhighlight %}

Now you are ready to create the first GTK3 application.
Create a new file named **warming-up.rb** and type the following commands

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "gtk3"

app = Gtk::Application.new("org.rubygtkfun.warmingup", :flags_none)

app.signal_connect "activate" do |application|
  window = Gtk::ApplicationWindow.new(application)
  window.set_title("My first window")
  window.set_default_size(400, 400)
  window.show_all
end

puts app.run
{% endhighlight %}

We need to give execution privileges to **warming-up.rb**:
{% highlight bash %}
chmod +x warming-up.rb
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can run it:
{% highlight bash %}
./warming-up.rb
{% endhighlight %}

If you typed the code correctly and the gtk gem was well installed you should be seeing something that looks like the aside image.

**Congratulations!!**

Let's see what have we typed line by line.

### Before we start
Remember the shebang in the first line helps us to define which interpreter must be used to execute the script under UNIX/Linux operating systems.

### First code block
We need to import the gtk3 library.

{% highlight ruby %}
require "gtk3"
{% endhighlight %}

### Second code block
We can initialize a new application writing: 

{% highlight ruby %}
app = Gtk::Application.new("org.rubygtkfun.warmingup", :flags_none)
{% endhighlight %}

The initializer takes two parameters:

* org.rubygtkfun.warmingup: this is our applicationâ€™s id and in general it should be a reverse DNS style identifier. For more information about its usage check out [the gnome documentation about the](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ChooseApplicationID)

* :flags_none: this is a flag defining the behavior of the application. In our case, we used the default behavior. [There are many types of application you can define](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/GObject-2.0/flags.html#GObject.GFlags). 

### Third code block
The following block of code connects the application [signal](http://ruby-gnome.sourceforge.net/programming/signal.html) named **activate** to the following commands. Gtk library is driven by signals. Gtk programming consists, in large part, in setting signals handlers. When the **activate** signal is received the following lines of code create a new window, give to this window a title and a size and show the window.

{% highlight ruby %}
app.signal_connect "activate" do |application|
  window = Gtk::ApplicationWindow.new(application)
  window.set_title("My first window")
  window.set_default_size(400, 400)
  window.show_all
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Forth code block

Last instruction runs the application and writes the console output on the terminal.

{% highlight ruby %}
puts app.run
{% endhighlight %}

### Final considerations

This was our first application, the "hello world" application, I hope the explanation was useful and clear for you.

See you next time.
