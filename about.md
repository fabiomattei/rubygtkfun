I love ruby and I love the Gnome project!

Many people have been involved in web ruby projects but when it comes to desktop apps ruby is not so popular.

I thing ruby has the potential to be a good language for desktop applications but it lacks documentation.

I am not an expert in Gtk but somebody says that there is not better way to learn something than teach it, so I thought it would be a good idea starting a blog about the path I am following.

I have just written the first article of my blog and I feel so excited!

Let's start!
