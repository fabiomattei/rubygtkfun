# GTK and Ruby

GTK is the foundation of Gnome environment.
It is the library that makes possible to create all applications.

Ruby is the langue that Matz invented and many peoples loves

I am going to use this page in order to take not of all the experiments I am going to make
with Ruby and GTK.

### installation

I am going to use Ubuntu 20.04 that installs Ruby version 2.7.0

In order to use the GTK library We need to install the gtk3 gem. We can do that typing in the terminal
{% highlight bash %}
gem install gtk3
{% endhighlight %}
