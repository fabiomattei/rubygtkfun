# GTK and Ruby

GTK is the foundation of Gnome environment.
It is the library that makes possible to create all the amazing Gnome applications.

Ruby is the language that Yukihiro Matsumoto (aka Matz) designed and many people love.

I am going to use this page in order to take note of all the experiments I am going to make
with Ruby and GTK.

### installation

I am going to use Ubuntu 20.04 that installs Ruby version 2.7.0

In order to use the GTK library we need to install the gtk3 gem. We can do that typing in the terminal
{% highlight bash %}
gem install gtk3
{% endhighlight %}
